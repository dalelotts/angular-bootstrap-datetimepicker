## Support the project
I know this is a tiny component but many people use it in production (high 5 to all of us) - if you happen to use this component please click the star button (at the top of the page) - it means a lot to all the contributors.

## Peer Dependencies

Peer dependencies:
 * Angular 7.x or higher (1.x will not work)
 * moment.js 2.22.2 or higher for date parsing and formatting
 * bootstrap 4.x for css/layout
 * open-iconic for the default icon's (you can use any icon libary you like)
 
jQuery is NOT required.

## Usage with Angular CLI
If you are using the [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) there are a few simple steps to 
add this component to your project.

First, install this module and it's peer dependencies.

```shell
npm install --save angular-bootstrap-datetimepicker bootstrap moment open-iconic
```

Then update `./src/app/app.module.ts` to include the following:

```TypeScript
import { AppComponent } from './app.component';
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { DlDateTimeDateModule, DlDateTimePickerModule } from 'angular-bootstrap-datetimepicker';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    FormsModule,
    DlDateTimeDateModule,  // <--- Determines the data type of the model
    DlDateTimePickerModule,
  ],
  providers: [FormsModule],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

Next, add the following to `./src/app/app.component.html`

```html
<dl-date-time-picker
	startView="day"
	maxView="year"
	minView="minute"
	minuteStep="5"
	[(ngModel)]="selectedDate"
>
</dl-date-time-picker>
```

Next, add the following to `./src/styles.css`

```css
@import '~bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';
@import '~open-iconic/font/css/open-iconic-bootstrap.css';
```

**Note:** This component uses `open-iconic` icons by default, but you can use any icon library 
that supports styling with `classes`.

Finally, run `npm start` and you should see the date/time picker on [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/)

By default, the date/time picker is as wide as it's container `{ width:100% }`. 
It uses bootstrap's flex `row` and `col` classes to layout the date/time picker into rows and columns.
If the parent container is too narrow (less than 340px in english), the row and column layout may wrap in ways that are not attractive. 
Other languages/locals may require a wider container to fit the contents.

## Configuration

Use the [automated configuration generator](https://stackblitz.com/github/dalelotts/angular-bootstrap-datetimepicker-demo) (please let me know if it does not work for your use case!), 
or see [https://dalelotts.github.io/angular-bootstrap-datetimepicker/](https://dalelotts.github.io/angular-bootstrap-datetimepicker/)
for the automatically generated documentation.

### First day of week

The first day of the week is determined by  [moment's i18n settings](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/i18n/).
For example, setting the locale to `'fr'` will cause Monday to be the first day of the week.  

### Display of year, month, day, hour, am/pm, and minute formats

The format of hours and minutes is also determined by [moment's i18n settings](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/i18n/).

hours are displayed using `ll` as the format.
minutes are displayed using `lll` as the format. 

I recommend you use the default locale settings from Moment (if they are incorrect, submit a PR to moment to correct the settings)
If for some reason the default Moment settings will not work, you can [customize the existing locale](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/customization/) or [create a custom locale](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/i18n/adding-locale/) with the desired formats.


## Documentation

You can generate the documentation by running `npm run documentation`
or see [https://dalelotts.github.io/angular-bootstrap-datetimepicker/](https://dalelotts.github.io/angular-bootstrap-datetimepicker/)

## Accessibility

The `DlDateTimePickerComponent` component adds `aria-label` attributes to the left, right, and up buttons
in addition to all calendar cells where the text of the cell may not fully describe the value.

| `LEFT_ARROW`         | Go to the cell to the left                      |
| `RIGHT_ARROW`        | Go to the cell to the right                     |
| `UP_ARROW`           | Go to the cell above                            |
| `DOWN_ARROW`         | Go to the cell below                            |
| `HOME`               | Go to the first cell in the view                |
| `END`                | Go to the last cell in the view                 |
| `PAGE_UP`            | Go to the same cell in the previous time period |
| `PAGE_DOWN`          | Go to the same cell in the next time period     |
| `ENTER` or `SPACE`   | Select current cell                             |

### Testing
This component was written using TDD and all enhancements and changes have related tests.

We use karma and jshint to ensure the quality of the code. The easiest way to run these checks is to use gulp:

```shell
npm install
npm test

The karma task will try to open Chrome as a browser in which to run the tests.
Make sure Chrome is available or change the browsers setting in karma.config.js
