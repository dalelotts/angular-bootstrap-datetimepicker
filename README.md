# (Almost) Complete re-write

This project started as an AngularJS specific re-write of the [bootstrap-datetimepicker project](https://github.com/smalot/bootstrap-datetimepicker).
Only the CSS file from the bootstrap-datetimepicker project was re-used.

#Dependencies

Requires:
 * AngularJS 1.2.11 or higher (1.0.x will not work)
 * moment.js for date parsing and formatting
 * bootstrap's dropdown component (`dropdowns.less`)
 * bootstrap's glyphicons for arrows

#Testing
We use karma and jshint to ensure the quality of the code. The easiest way to run these checks is to use grunt:

```
npm install -g grunt-cli
npm install
```

The karma task will try to open Chrome as a browser in which to run the tests. Make sure this is available or change the configuration in test\test.config.js

#Usage
We use bower for dependency management. Add

```json
dependencies: {
    "angular-bootstrap-datetimepicker": "latest"
}
```

To your bower.json file. Then run

```html
bower install
```

This will copy the angular-bootstrap-datetimepicker files into your components folder, along with its dependencies.

Add the css:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="components/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="components/angular-bootstrap-datetimepicker/src/css/datetimepicker.css"/>
```

Load the script files in your application:
```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="components/moment/moment.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="components/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="components/angular/angular.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="components/angular-bootstrap-datetimepicker/src/js/datetimepicker.js"></script>
```

Add the date module as a dependency to your application module:

```html
var myAppModule = angular.module('MyApp', ['ui.bootstrap.datetimepicker'])
```

Apply the directive to your form elements:

```html
<datetimepicker data-ng-model="data.date"></datetimepicker>
```

## Callback functions

### on-set-time
Attribute on datetimepicker element

If the value of the on-set-time attribute is a function, the date time picker will call this function
passing in the selected value and previous value.
```html
<datetimepicker data-ng-model="data.date" data-on-set-time="onTimeSet"></datetimepicker>
```
This function will be called when the user selects a value on the minView.
```javascript
$scope.onTimeSet = function (newDate, oldDate) {
    console.log(newDate);
    console.log(oldDate);
}
```

## Configuration Options

### startView

String.  Default: 'day'

The view that the datetimepicker should show when it is opened.
Accepts values of :
 * 'minute' for the minute view
 * 'hour' for the hour view
 * 'day' for the day view (the default)
 * 'month' for the 12-month view
 * 'year' for the 10-year overview. Useful for date-of-birth datetimepickers.

### minView

String. 'minute'

The lowest view that the datetimepicker should show.

### minuteStep

Number.  Default: 5

The increment used to build the hour view. A button is created for each <code>minuteStep</code> minutes.

### dropdownSelector

When used within a Bootstrap dropdown, the selector specified in dropdownSelector will toggle the dropdown when a date/time is selected.

### weekStart

Number.  Default: 0

Allows to set a week's starting day. Should be between 0 and 6.

```html
<datetimepicker data-ng-model="data.date" data-datetimepicker-config="{'weekStart': 1}"></datetimepicker>
```

## Working with ng-model
The angular-bootstrap-datetimepicker directive requires ng-model and the picked date/time is automatically synchronized with the model value.

This directive also plays nicely with validation directives such as ng-required.

The angular-bootstrap-datetimepicker directive stores and expects the model value to be a standard javascript Date object.

## ng-required directive
If you apply the required directive to element then the form element is invalid until a date is picked.

Note: Remember that the ng-required directive must be explicitly set, i.e. to "true".

## Examples

### Inline component.

```html
<datetimepicker data-ng-model="data.date" ></datetimepicker>
```
### Inline component with data bound to the page with the format specified via date filter:

```html
<datetimepicker data-ng-model="data.date" ></datetimepicker>
```
```
<p>Selected Date: {{ data.date | date:'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm' }}</p>
```

Display formatting of the date field is controlled by Angular filters.

### As a drop-down:

```html
<div class="dropdown">
    <a class="dropdown-toggle" id="dLabel" role="button" data-toggle="dropdown" data-target="#" href="">
        Click here to show calendar
    </a>
    <ul class="dropdown-menu" role="menu" aria-labelledby="dLabel">
        <datetimepicker data-ng-model="data.date"
                        data-datetimepicker-config="{ dropdownSelector: '.dropdown-toggle' }"></datetimepicker>
    </ul>
</div>
```
In this example, the drop-down functionality is controlled by Twitter Bootstrap.
The <code>dropdownSelector</code> tells the datetimepicker which element is bound to the Twitter Bootstrap drop-down so
the drop-down is toggled closed after the user selectes a date/time.

### Drop-down component with associated input box.
```html
<div class="dropdown">
    <a class="dropdown-toggle my-toggle-select" id="dLabel" role="button" data-toggle="dropdown" data-target="#" href="">
        <div class="input-append"><input type="text" class="input-large" data-ng-model="data.date"><span class="add-on"><i
                class="icon-calendar"></i></span>
        </div>
    </a>
    <ul class="dropdown-menu" role="menu" aria-labelledby="dLabel">
        <datetimepicker data-ng-model="data.date"
                        data-datetimepicker-config="{ dropdownSelector: '.my-toggle-select' }"></datetimepicker>
    </ul>
</div>
```
In this example, the drop-down functionality is controlled by Twitter Bootstrap.
The <code>dropdownSelector</code> tells the datetimepicker which element is bound to the Twitter Bootstrap drop-down so
the drop-down is toggled closed after the user selectes a date/time.

## I18N

All internationalization is handled by Moment.js, see Moment's documention for details.
